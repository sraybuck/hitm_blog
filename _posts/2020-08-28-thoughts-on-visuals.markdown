## Some Ideas for Design Changes

I was really banking on the Hancock Collection to provide most of my visuals for the original concept since I absolutely am not an artist. What this means for the new concept is that instead of a webcomic in the traditional comic-y sense with lots of visuals and panels, my comic will be mostly text but with a few visuals to convey the setting and mood. For example, the map at the top of this post is the map of the continent of Onterat, which is where my story is set. Its a bit rough since I made it pretty quickly for my campaign and not originally for my HITM, but I'm planning on using a map as my chapter archive. The general idea is that as the user reads each chapter, they will get redirected back to the map where a new pin on a location will pop up which will link to the next chapter. Its kind of like how in video games, you unlock new things on the map and the screen will track over there and allow you to start the quest. 

Additionally, each chapter should have some visual element, so I came up with the idea to use creative commons images of general landscapes as sort of Avengers-esque titlecards. For example, in Civil War, all the locations are accompanied by an establishing shot with big text like so:

![London establishing shot]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/london.png)

![Vienna establishing shot]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/vienna.png)

Also, this popular European teen drama show, Skam, does a similar thing with timestamps. Heres some screenshots of scenes from Skam France:

![Honestly I didn't watch this clip, I just liked the cityscape]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/wednesday.png)

So I figured since its an easy and clear way to set up the location, tone, and also timeframe, I could pretty easily leverage this kind of a visual for my comic. Huge, high quality, generic landscape and location shots within the Creative Commons licence are pretty easy to find online, the only problem is how to use these stock photos to convey a high fantasy atmosphere and also have a consistent visual aesthetic. I asked my girlfriend for help with this since Adrianna is a digital artist and they've done this kind of thing for a bunch of internships. They pitched this idea of using Photoshop filters to create an illustrated appearance to normal stockphotos like this one of just a field of wheat or grass:

Which they turned into this:

![Finished version after A TON of help from Adrianna]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/grass_text.png)

They used an oil painting filter to make the image look more illustrated while also using an overlay of a jpg-to-pencil-sketch conversion of the original to get those sketchy lines that outline the wheat. They also used a color burn effect to make sure that the colors don't get washed out by the sketch layer (which has a white background since it's wicked hard to take the background off of and make transparent). My original attempt at this before I took it to Adrianna looked like this: 

![washed out version]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/grass_sketched.png)

Which SUCKS, so big shout-out to Adrianna for being really great at Photoshop.

I think that between the map archive concept, establishing titlecards and then some smart interface design, the lack of illustrations shouldn't detract from the overall design of the comic. That being said, this is a pretty preliminary part of the process so if I figure out later on that I really do need some illustrations, I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.
