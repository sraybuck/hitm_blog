<h2 id="so-what-did-i-change-and-why">So What Did I Change and Why</h2>

<p>In my last post I talked how I was unhappy with the interface as I designed it because of how the page looked “sparse” and because of how weird the text looked on the header images. I consulted my in-house graphic designer again (my girlfriend, Adrianna) and we figured out that the reason the interface looked off was because of how I formatted the text. Usually, there are sizeable breaks in large swaths of text online and the paragraph breaks are in much more manageable breaks. My original design had the text running into itself with huge margins, in order to mimic a novel layout. After I looked at some examples, I spaced out the text a lot more and made the margins much smaller so the text appears in shorter paragraphs.</p>

<p>The second thing we fixed was my text-on-image problem. As I mentioned before, text over images is difficult to read without the right contrast, and my attempt to keep a consistent text color for the light and dark modes meant that it would be basically impossible to read the text. So to fix this, Adrianna suggested the slightly transparent text box over the images to provide the necessary contrast to be legible. I think the boxes work really well because I can use either white or dark blue rectangles to keep up the color consistency in the light and dark modes, and contrast the text colors.</p>

<p>The new screens were just my spin on what the homescreen and map archive should look like based on the design choices I made with the chapter designs. The only notable inclusions are the header image, where I tried to pick a visually interesting but mostly generic light motif so that I could connect it to recurring instances of light in the narrative and design, and the new map. If you look waaaaaaay back to my first post, I included my rudimentary map of Onterat that I was using for my DnD campaign, which is too unfocused and zoomed out for my purposes. The whole of the narrative mostly stays in three relatively close locations: Chantelle, Rusken, and Lathander’s Light in the Ferrow Wastes. The new map I’ve included is a closer view of those three locations so that the map can dynamically highlight between the three based on where the next chapter is set.</p>

<h2 id="into-october">Into October</h2>

<p>So now begins the portion of the project where I lock myself in my room and force myself to write two chapters a week for four weeks. Because October will be so narrative-focused, the reflection questions I’ve been working with will largely become obsolete until November. I talked to Dr. Neal and we discussed that I should approach the first October blog post as a more stream-of-consciousness reflection, and then use the recurring themes from that post to inform the new questions I should use. So expect a change of format in the weeks to come.</p>

<h2 id="reflection-questions">Reflection Questions</h2>

<p>1) What challenges did I encounter this week?</p>

<p>The main challenge for me is to revise and critique my own work because I don’t have a great artist’s intuition. For me, if I construct a design logically and methodically in my mind it should probably work fine, because thats how I approach both writing and coding and it usually turns out pretty well for me. But the reality of interface design is much more fickle and aesthetically based. For example, I slapped the text into the first interface in a way that resembles a novel because logically, I am essentially writing a long-form fiction project, so the same sort of presentation should probably work, right? Wrong! It just doesn’t work. People don’t have the atteniton span online to read text formatted like that, and it directly contradicts existing convention which makes it unpleasant and sort of hostile to approach. I’ve long been a champion for medium-specific composition, but its hilarious how quickly we become hypocrites when we’re not criticizing other people’s work and we have to actually make something. Aesthetics and design don’t come naturally to me, but thankfully I do have people in my network who can help me out.</p>

<p>2) How am I crafting the comic towards the web medium in this phase of the project ?</p>

<p>Like I mentioned before, the main way I’m crafting this for the web is by taking into considerations the conventions of web text. Its interesting, to get the right feel for the spacing I had to think of other places on the web where there is long-form storytelling going on so I could compare my text layout to theirs. I really only came up with two main places: news sites and fanfiction archives. The most informative were the fanfiction archives just because people are doing really interesting work with the HTML editors of many sites to create almost pseudo-interfaces and designs within their text. Some fun examples are designs such as simulating text conversations, social media posts, and interruptive narration. I’m not quite ready to get that experimental, but the text layout was helpful since it illustrated short chunks of text that were easy to skim or skip if needed but also an approachable length to reading online.</p>

<p>3) Am I incorporating the five aspects of interactivity, movement, interface, infinite canvas and experimentation at this stage and if so, how am I doing it?</p>

<p>I’m definitely working on interface for all of the reasons aforementioned, but I’m also thinking about interactivity, movement and experimentation. For example, seeing the map as a static image really reinforced the need for me to somehow animate the glowing circle that indicates the location of the next chapter and somehow allow the user to scroll around the map a little bit like in google maps. Additionally, I was thinking I could hide clues for unlocking the final chapter in the header images, similar to a technique I mentioned in my prospectus. The idea is that the user will become so used to the header images just providing passive context that the idea that I’ve hidden things in plain sight there will be a fun way to disrupt the reader’s perception of the design and bring more attention to the images themselves as parts of the narrative.</p>
