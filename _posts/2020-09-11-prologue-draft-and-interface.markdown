## Prologue Draft and Interface Base
This week my goals were to get my Prologue drafted and get a base template for my interface design. I am happy to say that I met both those goals! I currently have a working draft of my prologue that I'm going to polish up a little this weekend before starting on either Chapter 1 or the flashbacks. I think I might start on the flashbacks because I have a much better sense of direction with those scenes and I'm still working out my writing process. I ran into some writers block, mostly because it was a long weekend and I was on vacation in Tampa, but I'll discuss that more in the reflection questions. 

I've also selected a base template to work with for the interface, I went through several Jekyll themes and I picked [Alembic](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/alembic) mostly because it's designed to be customizable and have things built on top of it. I had tried to edit some other themes in simple ways like adjusting colors and fonts just to see how simple they would be to work with, and it ended up being virtually impossible due to the code organization and lack of documentation. Based on those tests, it seems like most of these themes are made to be used pretty much out of the box without any customization, which is why Alembic appealed to me. From what I can see, its highly commented, logically arranged, and engineered for developers. 

Additionally, I liked some of the default settings like the serif fonts and the minimalist design that felt like they lent themselves into the overall tone of what I'm looking for. It also has built-in header images in the template, which isn't necessarily difficult to do but it is something I had planned to incorporate into my design so it was very convenient to see. Right now the theme defaults to a white-on-black color scheme with some extraneous navbar options. Next week I'm going to try to make essentially a "dark mode" alternative version of it without that extra clutter and with a dark color scheme. I'll also try to consult with my friend who does interface design and mock up some sketches that I can use to develop wireframes. The goal here is to get a functional, customized interface template by the end of the month. 

## Reflection Questions
1. What challenges did I encounter this week?

I hit some bumps with writers block and almost a paralysis of what to write. I have my outline, which informs what I'm trying to do in each scene in broad strokes, but when I get down to actually writing the scene, I don't have a solid plan of what happens beat-by-beat so I get stuck. I think the remedy for this is just to not jump into writing right away, and spend 10-15 minutes doing a bullet point outline of the finer details of the scene. I'm going to try this with the next scene I write and see if it helps at all. 

2. How am I crafting the comic towards the web medium in this phase of the project ? 

As I'm picking an interface template, I'm trying to adhere to the current standards and trends of design to make sure my website looks appealing while also staying true to the tone and look I want my comic to have. This sounds pretty easy, but its hard for me to reconcile the current sleek and minimalist design trends with the gritty, detailed, and intentionally archaic aesthetics of high fantasy. I think a good compromise between the two is to focus on the typography and images as points of reference for the fantasy aesthetics, while the negative space and overall design adheres to current web standards. For example, this would mean that the header images all reflect the setting of my story and I use serif or handwriting fonts, while also effectively using white space, minimalist navigation, and limiting the amount of visual clutter in general. 

3. Am I incorporating the five aspects of interactivity, movement, interface, infinite canvas and experimentation at this stage and if so, how am I doing it?

I would say right now I'm highly focused on interface, but just the early stages. I think my answer to #2 also covers this one pretty well, but I'd like to add some of my recent thoughts on interactivity. 

In my prospectus, I mostly focused on interactivity in terms of the user affecting the narrative or unlocking additional content. Within the scope of this project, additional effort authoring alternate storylines or easter eggs is probably going to be a bad move since the initial scope is already pretty ambitious. Dr. Neal and I have talked a few times about building flexibility into my timeline and being prepared to scale down the narrative if its too much work for just one semester. That leaves the question of interactivity up in the air, since if it's going to be a squeeze just to finish the base of the comic, how can I build in all these extra interactive components that expand on that base?

I kicked around this question for the past week and decided that I needed to focus on interactivity not as bonus content but as a feature baked into the comic from the beginning. A core part of the interactivity is probably going to be the archive/map which will require users to click on places on the map to access chapters. But I also considered a more game-ified concept where I would make a secret code input form on each chapter that would require the user to find a code imbedded within the last chapter to access the next one. Then, at the end of the comic, I could create a page that would rearrange all the keywords/phrases into a message central to the comic's themes before providing access to the last chapter.

I like this idea for a number of reasons. First, because I would be pulling from existing content (i.e. the chapters themselves) to include interactive components instead of making new content. Second, I could design the comic to then be a hidden archive of the narrative instead of just a presentation of it, which would give the overall design of the website more relevance to the narrative. Third, I like it because its exactly the kind of thing I would get a kick out of if I stumbled across it on the internet. Secret puzzles to unlock the next chapter of an epic quest? Sixteen-year-old me would have thought this was the coolest thing ever. 

### A Note on the Header Images for These Posts

I'm going to try to find a header image for these posts that I can reuse in the comic for those setting images I mentioned in my first post. For example, today's header image is of the inside of a bar which is one of the planned settings for Scene 2. So if you're wondering why the images have no relevance to what I'm talking about, thats why. I'm just trying to get out ahead of the design work and create a repository of stuff to pull from.
