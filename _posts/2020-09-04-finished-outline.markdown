## My Outline is Done!
I took this week to create an outline of all the scenes I'm going to include in the narrative portion of the comic. The link is up in a google doc [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EH0xDrZKqajHxPXnFrAnQjal7DU9B8oa/view?usp=sharing), its more of a guideline than a strict script to stick to but the exercise of putting all my thoughts down in a coherent structure really helped me flesh out parts of the comic that I had overlooked or forgotten to consider. A huge piece that I had done pretty much no thinking about prior to this week was the plot of the comic outside the scope of my main character's internal journey, so I came up with sort of this evil heist idea that our heroes could foil that seems like it would be fun to lay out the clues for. As always, any feedback you have is welcome. 

## Critical Reflections
After talking to Dr. Neal, we decided that part of these blog posts going forward would be some reflection questions I would answer every week that focus on my thesis and the critical evaluation piece I'll be writing on this comic after I've finished it. I settled on these three questions after rereading my prospectus: 
1. What challenges did I encounter this week?
2. How am I crafting the comic towards the web medium in this phase of the project ? 
3. Am I incorporating the five aspects of interactivity, movement, interface, infinite canvas and experimentation at this stage and if so, how am I doing it?

I think these will cover most of the bases of my thesis while also the stream of consciousness style I've been employing in the past few posts will give me a lot to pull from when I go to write my evaluative paper at the end of all this. To answer the questions for this week I would say that: 

1. My main challenge was just trying to think of everything I needed to create a small, but fully detailed and interesting story. Because I picked the fantasy medium, I have to come up with so many things from the ground up like settings, fantasy character names, magical artifacts, conventions for magic and a whole host of other things. If I were just doing a realistic fiction kind of story, it would be easy to just say "The story is set in Paris - 2020" as opposed to "The story is set in Chantelle, one of the three triplet cities that form the seat of power for the Triumvirate, the ruling entity of the northern half of the continent of Onterat..." I think this is a fun challenge though because it frees me up to treat the whole project like a blank canvas without a whole lot of convention to stick to, and I think that because of that open mindset, I'll get some interesting results. 

(Off topic but important -  the header image for this post is just a random cathedral picture that I liked and figured I might use for Chantelle because the gothic architecture is the aesthetic I'm going for)

2. I'm really not crafting the webcomic towards any one medium right now, specifically. This could likely work in a number of formats but the one thing I'll say in the web's favor at this point is that the length and segmentation of the story do lend itself to an online serial format. Its at a really weird length for most things in the print medium and the only other written works that resemble this structure (that I know of, but I'm biased) are really online original fiction and fanfiction. 

3. I am not! This is a planning stage! Wooooo! I had some ideas about interactivity, interface and the map archive but those warrant their own post which will probably go up this weekend sometime.

## Moving Forward!
The next step here is to get writing and also get designing. In the next week im going to find some templates for light and dark themes that I can use as baselines for my current timeline/ flashback timeline interfaces and get ahold of my friend who does interface design and see if we can start to work on some wireframes. Because I'm now bringing someone else into the fold, I don't know if next Friday is a good deadline for wireframes, especially with the holiday weekend but I want to at least get those baseline template ideas and start writing the Prologue by next Friday. Also, I've decided I'll post weekly on Fridays to give updates about where the project is going and reflect, while some smaller posts will happen intermittently as I have ideas I want to record.
