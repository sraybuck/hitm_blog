## Do These Count as Wireframes??
I did take a UI/UX class but I still don't entirely know the difference between wireframes and mock-ups. I don't actually have any wireframing or prototyping software so I just made some mock-ups in Photoshop. I made two general designs, a dark mode for the Chantelle timeline and a light mode for the Rusken/Lathander's Light timeline. For each of those I made alternates with and without the text over the big header image just to see what it would look like. I'm not a huge fan of the text because I want to have the typography remain consistent in each mode, but with text on pictures, how well the text shows up will determine the colors most of the time. You can see this pretty well in the text versions

I like the designs overall, but I definitely feel like something is missing. It seems sparse, almost. Then again, most websites have more bullet points, short paragraphs, images, videos and stuff than just a block of narrative text so it may just be the format I'm working in. I'm going to revise these over the week, so hopefully I'll have an update by friday.

If you guys have any comments or suggestions, please let me know! I'm really looking for feedback since these feel off to me.

## Darkmode

### Lightmode

I also need to make a mock-up of what I want the map/archive page to look like. Because the story is mostly told in the present with the flashbacks supporting that storyline, I want the darkmode to be the default for the website but so far, I think the lightmode looks better. Therefore, I need to tweak the dark version and then use that to inform how I make the map page. Once I get those designs nailed down, I think I will have met my September goal and I'll be able to take the designs into the development phase in November.
