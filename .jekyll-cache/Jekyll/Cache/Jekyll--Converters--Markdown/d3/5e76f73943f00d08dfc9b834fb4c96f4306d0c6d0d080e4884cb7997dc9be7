<p>I was really banking on the Hancock Collection to provide most of my visuals for the original concept since I absolutely am not an artist. What this means for the new concept is that instead of a webcomic in the traditional comic-y sense with lots of visuals and panels, my comic will be mostly text but with a few visuals to convey the setting and mood. For example, the map at the top of this post is the map of the continent of Onterat, which is where my story is set. Its a bit rough since I made it pretty quickly for my campaign and not originally for my HITM, but Iâ€™m planning on using a map as my chapter archive. The general idea is that as the user reads each chapter, they will get redirected back to the map where a new pin on a location will pop up which will link to the next chapter. Its kind of like how in video games, you unlock new things on the map and the screen will track over there and allow you to start the quest.</p>

<p>Additionally, each chapter should have some visual element, so I came up with the idea to use creative commons images of general landscapes as sort of Avengers-esque titlecards. For example, in Civil War, all the locations are accompanied by an establishing shot with big text like so:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/london.png" alt="London establishing shot" /></p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/vienna.png" alt="Vienna establishing shot" /></p>

<p>Also, this popular European teen drama show, Skam, does a similar thing with timestamps. Heres some screenshots of scenes from Skam France:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/friday.png" alt="Before a party in the woods on friday at 22:22" />
<img src="/blog/assets/img/saturday.png" alt="Scene at an old racetrack on satruday" />
<img src="/blog/assets/img/wednesday.png" alt="Honestly I didn't watch this clip, I just liked the cityscape" /></p>

<p>So I figured since its an easy and clear way to set up the location, tone, and also timeframe, I could pretty easily leverage this kind of a visual for my comic. Huge, high quality, generic landscape and location shots within the Creative Commons licence are pretty easy to find online, the only problem is how to use these stock photos to convey a high fantasy atmosphere and also have a consistent visual aesthetic. I asked my girlfriend for help with this since Adrianna is a digital artist and theyâ€™ve done this kind of thing for a bunch of internships. Together we created this idea of using Photoshop filters to create an illustrated appearance to normal stockphotos like this one of just a field of wheat or grass:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/grass.jpeg" alt="Stock photo I got from Unsplash.com" /></p>

<p>Which we turned into this:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/grass_text.png" alt="Finished version after A TON of help from Adrianna" /></p>

<p>I think that between the map archive concept, establishing titlecards and then some smart interface design, the lack of illustrations shouldnâ€™t detract from the overall design of the comic. That being said, this is a pretty preliminary part of the process so if I figure out later on that I really do need some illustrations, Iâ€™ll cross that bridge when I get to it.</p>
