<p>I apologize for posting last week’s update so late, I held off mostly because I wanted to give a substantively positive update with some significant progress. Because I turned in my last midterm on Saturday, I had most of the weekend to write and get organized so I am now done with Chapters 1 and 2, with a roadmap for 3 and plans for 4 and 5. I’ve also reformatted and cleaned up all my other previous writings (prologue, flashback 1), and put the files up online so you guys can see it. Heres the project as it currently stands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prologue: COMPLETE DRAFT</li>
  <li>CHAPTER1: COMPLETE DRAFT</li>
  <li>FLASHBACK 1: COMPLETE DRAFT</li>
  <li>CHAPTER 2: COMPLETE DRAFT</li>
  <li>FLASHBACK 2: on hold until November</li>
  <li>CHAPTER 3: OUTLINE PENDING, TO BE COMPLETED WEEK 3</li>
  <li>Flashback 3: on hold until November</li>
  <li>CHAPTER 4: TO BE COMPLETED WEEK 3/4</li>
  <li>CHAPTER 5: TO BE COMPLETED WEEK 4</li>
</ul>

<p>So as you can see, I’m totally done with the first four chapters with just three to go for the last two weeks of October. I think its going to be lots of work, but I can finish my main chapters by the end of the month. Especially now that midterms are over, my head has stopped hurting, and I’ve found my groove while writing, I’m very optimistic about what I can get done this month and I’m excited to share what I’ve made.</p>

<p>For my thesis advisors, in my email you should have gotten a link to a github repository full of markdown files. I put it up in github because I’ve been composing exclusively in markdown since I find it less daunting than an empty word doc, and if you click on each of the file links it’ll show you a rendered version of the markdown. I’ll also keep an updated record of my progress in there on that README file so you can see when I’ve outlined something or started working on a draft.</p>

<h2 id="reflection-questions">Reflection Questions</h2>

<p>1) How am I writing to complement or change the expectations and meaning generated by my design?</p>

<p>Again, because I’m in the main chapters I’m really trying to focus on that dark, gothic aesthetic that I’ve cultivated with the darkmode theme. In Chapter 2, I have to play this delicate balance between the fast friendship of Renard and Audrey while also still showing that Audrey is stuck in a very dark place. It helps that all the action takes place at night, so I can intentionally include darker surroundings and details but its been hard to hit all the thematic and aesthetic points I need to while also just getting everything down that I need to in order to make the plot and story progression work. Right now, its much more jumbled up and less streamlined than I want it to be, but I can go back and tighten the ship when I do some revision.</p>
