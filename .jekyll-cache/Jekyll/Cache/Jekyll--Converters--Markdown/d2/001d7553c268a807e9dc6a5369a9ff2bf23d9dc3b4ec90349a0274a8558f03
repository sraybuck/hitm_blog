<p>I thought it was kind of fun how lots of artists participate in a yearly trend called “Inktober” where they do a drawing a day and post it on social media. I always wanted to participate in a structured creativity month like this, I almost tried my hand at NaNoWriMo a few times, but never quite found the time or inspiration to do so. So its pretty ironic that it only occurred to me today, October 9th, that I’m accidentally participating in my own version of Inktober where I sprint to the end of my narrative as fast as humanly possible.</p>

<p>I’ve been really enjoying regularity and structure that this has provided to my writing, and so far I’ve been fairly successful! My only mistake here was forgetting that the first and second weeks of October are effectively midterms, so in addition to writing every day I’ve been turning in projects and assignments left and right. I also managed to get a nasty screen strain migraine from all this, so my writing output has been less than what I’d hoped. Right now as I’m typing this I have both my chapters for this week outlined in broad strokes, and about 3/4 of the first one done. I have lots of time today and tomorrow to write, so I figure by the end of this week I will have 1 chapter fully drafted and maybe a quarter to a half of the second one done.</p>

<p>These things happen, and its hard to anticipate precisely when setbacks happen so my plan is just to roll with it and keep writing. I discussed with Michael that I don’t need all the chapters to be written in their entirety since I’m ultimately shooting for a proof-of-concept, not a literary masterpiece. The plan now is to write all my main chapters and then go back and write the flashback scenes since those are shorter and more flexible. That way, I’ll get the meat of my story down on figurative paper and the parts that I may not have time to finish aren’t as consequential. That being said, I’m optimistic about this month and what I can get done and I’m having a ton of fun writing this! This concept has been baking in the back of my mind since about freshman year so its incredibly exciting and edifying to see it start to come to life.</p>

<p>I’ve also modified my reflection questions to better fit with this phase of the project. Michael and I settled on the question “How am I writing to complement or change the expectations and meaning generated by my design?” going forward since this phase is much more focused on content versus form.</p>

<p>Speaking of form, Dr. Graban sent me some great design feedback this past week and I wanted to write down the changes I want to make to my design in November for posterity:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We both agreed that my map clashed with the noir tone I had been cultivating with the rest of the design. Compared to the dark blues, harsh lines, minimalism and empty landscape images in my interface, the cartoon-y hand-drawn map is distinctly light and whimsical. My final map should be more tonally consistent and less whimsical, I have an idea of where to look to find more noir and gothic map assets but I’m waiting to finalize that until November.</li>
  <li>We discussed the design around the header image and the title text over it. Dr. Graban pointed out that having the title text over the image is slightly jarring, and I’m inclined to agree. I experimented with the boxes to create enough contrast for readability, and messed with the font size but I’m not sure how much I like the idea anymore. I had been basing the concept of title text over images on various video formats like movies and TV shows where they use this kind of text-on-image to impart setting information during scene changes. Because I’m not constrained to a single pane of images for my project, I think moving the title text below the image and letting the picture stand on its own would probably work within a reader’s expectations of the format much better. Also it would allow the reader to consider them separately, instead of detracting attention from one or the other since they’re combined. This is much further down the line, but I also like this idea because I want to combine all the header images into a gif for my second to last scene where my protagonist’s memories all flood back into her mind at once. My idea here is that the reader will recognize all these header images and to see them quickly flashing and alternating will give them a sense of disorientation and confusion of time and place, much like my character is experiencing. With the title text included, I think there would be way too much going on in the gif to make sense of it between the huge changing text and backgrounds and it would ruin the effect I’m going for. Without the text I think it could convey the kind of disruptive, flashing, confusing imagery that I’m writing in the scene and it’ll be a great way to tie movement into my interface.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="reflection-questions">Reflection Questions</h2>

<p>1) How am I writing to complement or change the expectations and meaning generated by my design?</p>

<p>Since I’m writing my first chapter which initially introduces the reader to the setting of Chantelle and the main characters of Audrey and Renard, I’m working mostly to cultivate the noir tones that I’ve created in my interface. I’m focusing a lot on making my setting feel dark, gritty, and slightly alienating with a few bright spots that get brighter as the narrative progresses. Its difficult because my natural inclination is always humor, I love entertaining and making people laugh with my writing but in this case I need to use that humor sparingly in order to make sure the feeling of the narrative is consistent overall. For the first few chapters the focus thematically is on isolation shifting to friendship as my character finds a genuine friend for the first time in years. This friend also helps her begin to understand her past and recover some memories so theres also undertones of confusion and self-doubt to reassurance and confidence. In order to make this shift work, I need to make the beginning scenes suitably bleak and alone for my main character, otherwise the reconciliation I’m teeing up with fall flat and also the darkness of the interface will seem largely out of step with my themes.</p>
